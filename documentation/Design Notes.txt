CySeCa and related projects - analysis tools

Outline
This work is to find the best tool set to be able to structurally analyse the outputs of workshops as developed in CySeCa, including the lived experience comic strips, the co-created lego models and the card mapping exercises. The outcomes of these workshops are relatively unstructured, and can be difficult to interpret unless you were involved in their creation.

What is needed is a way of high ligting the strutcured elements of the outcomes, and to be able to visulaise these structures in various ways for presentation and analysis. 

Components of outputs
The workshops generate artefacts, models, comic strips and system maps. All of these are created within rules and structures that are generated and owned by the workshop participants.

There are though a number of elements that are common across the workshops and
